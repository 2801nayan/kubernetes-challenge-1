# Name of Project
Deploy a security and compliance system
When you deploy an image you may also deploy a security threat, and images can become quickly insecure as new threats are discovered and disclosed. To continuously monitor and detect threats, you can deploy a tool like Falco.
I originally chose the project `Deploy a scalable message queue` but decided to switch over to Falco as I wanted to learn a bit more about security.
