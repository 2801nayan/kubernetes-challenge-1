## Misc
* Digital Ocean Kubernetes looks interesting as does their API. I have a lot of 
  experience with AWS EKS but their managed K8s system costs $73 a month
  (in us-west-2) whereas DO charges nothing for K8s itself and droplets cost 
  much less than EC2 instances.  
  
  Only shortcoming I have seen so far is I don't think there is a way to see
  managed node logs such as "kubelet" for troubleshooting.
